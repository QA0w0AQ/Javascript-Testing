# Practice Writing Expectations

Given the descriptions below, use your best judgement to determine how these functions should (and shouldn't) work.

---

1. "Write a function that, given an array of numbers, returns the sum of all of the positive ones."

2. "Write a function that, given an array of integers, finds and returns the smallest integer."

3. "Write a function that, given an array of numbers, returns an array with the duplicate numbers removed. The order of the sequence has to stay the same."

4. "Write a function that, given a string, returns a new string with the first and last characters removed."

5. "Write a function that, given two integers `n` and `m`, returns the sum of all the multiples of `n` that are less than `m`"
