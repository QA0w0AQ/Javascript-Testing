# Practice Writing Expectations

Given the descriptions below, use your best judgement to determine how these functions should (and shouldn't) work.

---

1. "Write a function that, given an array of numbers, returns the sum of all of the positive ones."

2. "Write a function that, given an array of integers, finds and returns the smallest integer."

---
### Write a function that, given an array of numbers, returns an array with the duplicate numbers removed. The order of the sequence has to stay the same.

1. Should accept an non-empty array
2. Array should contain only numbers, if not, throw an error
3. Should return an array of numbers
4. The order of the numbers in the array of the output, should be the same as the order of the array of the numbers in the input
5. Duplicates should be removed
---
### Write a function that, given a string, returns a new string with the first and last characters removed.

1. Should accept a string
2. Returns a string with the first and last character removed
3. Any string with less than 3 characters, returns an empty string 

---
### Write a function that, given two integers `n` and `m`, returns the sum of all the multiples of `n` that are less than `m`

1. Returns the the result of multiples of `n`
2. It should accept 2 numbers
3. Must only returns the sum of multiples of `n` less than `m` 
4. Numbers must be greater than 0
5. `m` must be greater than `n`
